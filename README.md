# FastCP
FastCP is an open source control panel for Ubuntu servers. You can use FastCP to deploy and manage multiple PHP / WordPress websites on a single server. ServerPilot's simplicity and powerful features are the inspiration behind FastCP's development. Moreover, I have developed this control panel as the final project of my CS50 online course.

## Features
* Host multiple websites on a single server
* Create multiple SSH users
* Sub users can manage their websites
* Limit on websites and databases for sub users
* Auto WordPress deploy
* Fully isolated user data using ACLs
* NGINX reverse proxy on Apache for performance + htaccess support
* Multiple PHP versions support. Change PHP version per website with a single click
* Auto SSLs from Let's Encrypt with auto renewal

## Requirements
FastCP only supports the latest LTS versions of Ubuntu starting 20.04. Please beware although it will run on non-LTS releases too, but we have imposed a strict requirement of LTS releases only. At the moment, FastCP supports the following Ubuntu releases:

* Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
